## Features Implemented



### Advanced Security & Recovery (v5.0.0)



| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |

|---------|----------------|---------|

| **AES-256-GCM** | Authenticated Encryption | Tamper-proof data with high performance. |

| **Secure Memory** | `bytearray` + Zeroing | Wipes keys from RAM immediately after use. |

| **BIP-39 Mnemonic** | 24-Word Phrase | Ultimate fail-safe if you lose phone AND password. |

| **TOTP Primary** | Authenticator Unlock | Quick daily access using your phone. |

| **Dual-Mode Recovery** | "Lost" vs "Temporary" | Smart handling for lost phones vs. temporary lockout. |



---



## The New Login & Recovery Flow



1. **Daily Access (TOTP)**: 

   - Enter your 6-digit code.

   - The vault unlocks using the Master Key wrapped by your TOTP secret.



2. **Lost Phone Recovery (Master Password)**:

   - Login → Select "I lost my phone".

   - **Forced security reset**: Password must be changed, and old TOTP link is destroyed.



3. **Temporary Recovery (Master Password)**:

   - Login → Select "Temporary access".

   - Vault unlocked, but a **persistent warning** stays in the header as a reminder.



4. **Absolute Recovery (Mnemonic)**:

   - The 24-word phrase generated at setup can reconstruct your access from scratch.



---



## Technical Stack Update

- **PyOTP**: TOTP generation/verification.

- **QRCode**: Setup assistance.

- **Argon2id**: High-security password hashing.

- **AES-GCM**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption.

- **Secure Memory**: Manual buffer management for keys.



### UI Features

- **4-tab interface**: Vault, Generator, Keys, Stats

- **Split-pane layout**: List + details view

- **Password strength meter** with color coding

- **Search and filter** passwords

- **Dark theme** with CustomTkinter



---



## v5.0.0 Updates

- Backup verification and restore workflows with integrity checks.
- Key Vault notes editing and certificate expiry filters.
- Private key import (PEM/OpenSSH) with passphrase prompt.
- Passphrase strength meter and visibility toggle.
- Session persistence hardened with device secret.
- Blob storage now uses in-memory DB to avoid plaintext temp files.

## Verification Results



| Test | Result |

|------|--------|

| Core module imports | ✅ Pass |

| Password generation | ✅ Pass |

| Key generation | ✅ Pass |

| GUI launch | ✅ Pass |

| Application exit | ✅ Clean (code 0) |

## First-Time Usage



1. Launch `python main.py`

2. Create a strong master password (min 8 chars, strength check required)

3. Your vault is created with encrypted database at `d:\pass\data\vault.db`

4. Use tabs to generate passwords/keys, store them, view stats

## Security Notes



> [!IMPORTANT]

> - Master password is **never stored** - only Argon2id hash

> - All vault fields encrypted with derived AES-256 key

> - Database file is encrypted at rest - unreadable without master password
